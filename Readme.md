# BlotDx - AI-enabled Western Blot-based Diagnostic Tool

Directory structure:

- Image1 contains the strip images. 

- Mask contains the mask files generated by detection/segmentation models.
    - In the masks images, the boundaries of the strips appear ragged, in contrast with the blot images, in which the boundary of the strips appear smooth. This is because in the images, the pixels are not black and white and so appear smooth to human eyes.

- Predicted_Labels contains the predicted labels generated by classification models.

- saved_tv13_models contains models saved at the end of training and used for inference

- TV contains scripts using Torchvision for training and testing segmentation, detection and classification models
  - torchvision.md contains bash scripts for training and testing segmentation, detection and classification models
  - pre_post_processing contains the scripts for data pre-processing and post-processing.
